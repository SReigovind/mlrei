# mlrei

**mlrei** is a lightweight machine learning library built from scratch in Python. It's a personal learning project aimed at implementing classic ML algorithms and utilities with clarity, modularity, and simplicity — with a future goal of adding high-performance C++ backends.

## 👤 About

I'm an MSc Artificial Intelligence student with some basic experience in Python, machine learning, and web development. This project is my way of upskilling by going beyond just using libraries — I want to understand and build them myself.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a clean, minimal Python library that implements foundational ML algorithms and utilities.
- Learn core concepts like gradient descent, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics by implementing them from scratch.
- Start small and grow organically — focusing first on correctness and structure.
- Eventually, re-implement performance-critical components in C++ and integrate them into Python using tools like `pybind11`.

## 📦 Features (Work in Progress)

- ✅ Naive Bayes classifier
- ✅ Train-test split utility
- ✅ Basic evaluation metrics (accuracy, MSE)
- ⏳ Linear Regression
- ⏳ K-Means Clustering
- ⏳ Neural Network (fully from scratch)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python (now), C++ (planned)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, scikit-learn (for testing only), pytest, matplotlib
- **Tools**: VS Code, pybind11, CMake, Git, GCC
- **Platform**: Linux (Kubuntu)

## 📚 Learning in Public

This is a personal learning journey — built step by step, mistake by mistake. The goal is to go deep, understand how things work under the hood, and document the process along the way.
